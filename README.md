This is a simple and not perfect game that i used for my Object Oriented Programming final project

Note : i did not create all of the codes by myself, some of the codes are from the internet and some of the codes i wrote myself to fulfill the project assignment's requirements

here is the original game code that i modify : https://code-projects.org/car-racing-game-in-java-with-source-code/
